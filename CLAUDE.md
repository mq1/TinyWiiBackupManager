# Notes for Claude

Read by every Claude Code session in this repository. The maintainer writes in German; answer in
German, keep code, commits and docs in English.

## Working with the maintainer

- **Recommend a new session proactively** as soon as it makes sense, without being asked: when
  the conversation has grown long, when the next piece of work doesn't need what this session
  knows (a new milestone, an unrelated topic), or when a fresh start is cheaper than carrying the
  context. Say so in one line, with what the new session should start with (branch, pull request,
  roadmap item).
- The maintainer tests on a Mac with real consoles and drives; cloud sessions can't. What waits
  for the Mac is listed in [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) under "Waiting for the Mac"; add
  to it whenever a change needs a real-hardware test.

## Where things are

- Plan and milestones: [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md); tests on real hardware:
  [docs/TESTLOG.md](docs/TESTLOG.md).
- Branches, commits, pull requests: [docs/GIT_WORKFLOW.md](docs/GIT_WORKFLOW.md). Checks before
  pushing, as CI runs them: `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets --locked -- -D
  warnings`, `cargo test --locked` (needs Rust 1.98 or newer: `rustup toolchain install stable`).
- AI rules: [AI_POLICY.md](AI_POLICY.md).
